## ▶️ **How to Run**

1. **Prepare the dataset** (Make sure the dataset is in CSV format, e.g., `transactions.csv`)
   
2. **Train the AI model**:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Detect fraudulent transactions**:
   ```bash
   python detect_fraud.py --input transactions.csv --output fraud_detection_report.pdf
   ```

   This will:
   - Analyze transaction patterns
   - Predict fraud likelihood
   - Generate a comprehensive report with detected fraud

## 🧠 **AI Model Highlights**

- ❌ **Identifies anomalies in transaction behavior**
- 🔥 **Predicts high-risk fraudulent transactions**
- 💡 **Uses machine learning techniques like Random Forests and Neural Networks**
- 📉 **Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics**

---

## 📁 **Output Format Details**

- **PDF Report**: Detailed report with visual graphs and fraud case breakdown
- **CSV Risk Scores**: Data file with risk scores for each transaction to identify high-risk cases
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the accuracy of the model to provide feedback on its reliability
