# 🚨AI-Powered Fraud Transaction Detection and Analysis 📊

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to **analyze synthetic fraud transaction data** and generate an insightful **PDF report**. The report includes:
- **Risk categorization**
- **Fraud probability analysis**
- **User behavior insights**
- **Financial impact evaluation**

The goal is to demonstrate the power of **data analysis** in detecting fraudulent transactions and improving financial decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- **💡 Synthetic Data Generation**: Automatically creates fraud transaction data with varying attributes.
- **📉 Risk Categorization**: Classifies transactions by risk levels (Low, Moderate, High, Ultra High) and fraud types (e.g., Card Fraud, Phishing Fraud).
- **⚡ Fraud Probability Analysis**: Assigns a fraud probability score to each transaction.
- **💰 Financial Impact Analysis**: Identifies high-value and high-risk transactions.
- **📊 Visualizations**: Bar charts, histograms, and pie charts to provide deeper insights.
- **📑 PDF Report Generation**: Creates a detailed **PDF report** with visualizations and analysis.

## 🛠️ Requirements
To run the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- **pandas**: `pip install pandas`
- **numpy**: `pip install numpy`
- **matplotlib**: `pip install matplotlib`
- **seaborn**: `pip install seaborn`
- **fpdf**: `pip install fpdf`

Install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn fpdf
```

## 💾 Dataset
The dataset is **synthetically generated** in the code. It includes the following fields for each transaction:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Amount**: The amount involved in the transaction.
- **Fraud Probability**: The likelihood that the transaction is fraudulent (0 to 1 scale).
- **Risk Level**: Categorized risk level (Low, Moderate, High, Ultra High).
- **Fraud Type**: Type of fraud (e.g., Card Fraud, Phishing Fraud).
- **User Behavior**: User behavior type (Normal, Suspicious, Confirmed Fraud).
- **Financial Impact**: Transaction value categories (Small, Medium, High).
- **Fraud Frequency**: Frequency of fraud (First-time Fraud, Repeat Offender, Multiple Fraud Attempts).

The dataset is generated dynamically when you run the script, so you don't need to upload or manually provide any data!

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-analysis-project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-analysis-project
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python fraud_analysis_report.py
   ```

5. **Check the generated report**: The PDF report will be saved as `fraud_analysis_report.pdf` in the same directory.

## 📈 Visualizations
Here’s a glimpse of the types of graphs and insights included in the report:

1. **Risk Level Distribution**  
   📊 A bar chart showing how the risk levels are distributed across the transactions.
   
2. **Fraud Probability Distribution**  
   📉 A histogram with a KDE curve showing the distribution of fraud probabilities.

3. **Fraud Outcome**  
   🥧 A pie chart depicting the percentage of legitimate vs fraudulent transactions.

4. **Fraud Type Distribution**  
   📊 A bar chart showing the distribution of different fraud types (e.g., Card Fraud, Phishing Fraud).

5. **User Behavior Anomalies**  
   📊 A bar chart classifying user behavior based on the fraud probability score.

6. **Financial Impact Distribution**  
   💰 A bar chart classifying transactions by their financial impact.

7. **Fraud Frequency**  
   📊 A bar chart showing the frequency of fraud occurrences per user.

8. **Top 10 Risk & Fraud Type Combinations**  
   📊 A horizontal bar chart showing the most common combinations of fraud risk levels and fraud types.
